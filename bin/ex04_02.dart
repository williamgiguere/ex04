There is a point in the center of a rectangle with the width of 800 and the height of 600 pixels (or millimeters on paper). The north-west corner of the rectangle has zero coordinates (x = 0, y = 0). Positive x numbers go towards the east of the rectangle. Positive y numbers go towards the south of the rectangle.

Draw a line on paper of the length of 160 pixels (millimeters) from the center of the rectangle under the angle of 45 degrees towards the south-east of the rectangle. This is only to help you calculate the following:

Given the center of the rectangle as the starting point and the angle of 45 degrees, calculate the end point of the line.

  int hypotenuse = 160;
